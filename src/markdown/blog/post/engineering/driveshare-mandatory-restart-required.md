Dear Storj Supporters,  
  
We have been upgrading our infrastructure and systems over the past few weeks in preparation for the next release. As part of this we restarted the DriveShare and dataserv-client backend monitoring services.  

<!--more-->

As a consequence, **all testers running the command line dataserv-client or the DriveShare GUI, must restart their clients** to keep participating in Test Group B and continue earning rewards. Simply restart all currently running clients, and everything will work normally.  
  
We appreciate your patience and support.

Have a great day!  
**The Storj Team**

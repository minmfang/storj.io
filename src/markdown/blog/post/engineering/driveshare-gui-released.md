**Dear Storj Supporters,**

As you can see above, DriveShare is pretty intuitive to use:

1\. Enter your SJCX Payout Address  
2\. Select where to keep the data  
3\. Select how much storage to share  
4\. Click start

This is an alpha build, there might still be issues. Please post an issue if you run into problems and please attach a screenshot with the logs window open (click View Logs). You can make bug reports here.

Next we are going to release a new version of the GUI, with multi-drive functionality (as pictured). Stay tuned! For any support questions feel free to ask away on our [Community Slack](http://slack.storj.io).

Thank you for being part of Test Group B! Please continue testing and enjoy the rewards!

Have a great day,  
**The Storj Team**

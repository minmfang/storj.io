**Dear Storj Supporters,**

We are thrilled to announce the release of the MetaDisk Alpha API. Our devs have been hard at work on this for the past few months and time has come to share our efforts with the community.  Below is a demo that shows how simple our API is to use for developers.

For all of you out there who like coding we are also launching an app competition. Build apps that use MetaDisk and be rewarded for it in Storjcoin X (SJCX). The first 25 working applications submitted to us will receive a prize of 1,000 SJCX (~90 USD at current prices), the top 5 apps will receive an additional 5,000 SJCX (~450 USD at current prices).  
  
You are free to design any kind of app so long as it’s functional and doesn’t promote or includes illegal material. Furthermore entries must be open source, on Github, and be publically accessible and executable. Once you are ready you can submit your apps in the [#metadisk](http://storj.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=edba9fc4ce8b9095a31859cba&id=faf12f3bbb&e=813daa4cbf) channel on our [Slack](http://storj.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=edba9fc4ce8b9095a31859cba&id=0757691855&e=813daa4cbf) which is open for everyone to join.  
  
The Storj team will judge the entries. We will reject silly entries, and direct submissions to fix obvious issues before accepting an entry.

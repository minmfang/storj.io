If you haven't already heard, [we launched the Explorer release](https://storj.io/blog/2019/02/announcing-the-storj-v3-explorer-release/)! We are sending invitations out every day to our [waitlist](https://storj.io/sign-up-farmer) participants, so if you joined the list be on the lookout. We had an all company meeting in Atlanta mid-January where the entire team focused its efforts on completing the release. If you started running a storage node and have some ideas on how we can improve the experience, or would like to request features, please submit them through our [Ideas portal](https://ideas.storj.io/). 

#### Recent development accomplishments:

- We launched the Explorer release! A ton of work went into this release - more than I can convey in this quick update. Please check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/storj/storj) commit history if you're interested. Youâ€™ll see that during this last sprint, we also reached [1,000 commits on our V3 network](https://twitter.com/storjproject/status/1090009984279097345).  
- We made some final adjustments to our Satellite GUI, which we will be launching in the Vanguard release. This is the web app users will sign up through to use the Storj network to store data. 
- We added support for multi-tenant Satellites. This will enable multiple people to use one Satellite.  
- Our team conducted an advanced training session during the Storj Labs all hands meeting, which taught us the proper way to brew a shot espresso.  
- Fixed a bunch of bugs to increase the user experience. 
 
#### In our next post, we plan to share updates on:

- Adding database migration support for storage nodes, which will streamline upgrades for storage node software. 
- How much progress we make with writing new tests in our test suite. We want to enhance our test suite to ensure the software is working as intended.  
- Fixing additional bugs we discovered as a result of heavy testing of the Explorer release. Because of all the great feedback from our first waves of storage node operators, we've identified a lot of bugs to fix and minor improvements to be made.

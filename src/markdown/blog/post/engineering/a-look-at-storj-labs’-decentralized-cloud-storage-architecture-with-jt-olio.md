In [our recent town hall meeting](https://storj.io/blog/2018/06/quarterly-update-storj-town-hall-3/), we took a quick look at our development team’s progress towards building V3 of the Storj Labs network. We kept it short because we realized that not everyone is interested in the fine, technical details of the platform’s inner workings. However, we know that many developers within our community love this kind of stuff. Because of that, we committed to delivering a longer presentation on network V3 that dives into how the new network will make improvements over the current version.

Michael is an entrepreneur, early-stage technology investor and Managing Director of Techstars Atlanta, in partnership with Cox Enterprises. Over his nearly 20-year career, Michael has served both large enterprises and start-ups in a variety of roles, including CEO, head of Marketing, head of Product Development and Programmer. Most recently, Michael co-founded Cloud Sherpas in 2008, and remained a member of the senior leadership team running Global Marketing as the business scaled to nearly $200MM revenue and over 1,100 employees before exiting to Accenture in 2015.

Tyler is a senior technology executive and early stage venture capitalist. Prior to joining Michael as a Director at TechStars in Atlanta, Tyler was previously based in Palo Alto as a member of the senior leadership team at Palantir Technologies, where he served as chief of staff and head of operations. During his five years with Palantir, he was broadly engaged in scaling the operations of the business from 100 to nearly 2,000 employees and saw the company grow to become one of the most valuable in Silicon Valley. He also co-founded ThinAir Labs, a Y Combinator-backed data security company. Tyler commented _"The power of the Storj platform is its unique ability to indiscriminately utilize the free capacity of a storage node, whether a single end-user PC or a massive data center. Storj is bringing an unprecedented degree of efficiency to globally distributed data storage."_

Warren is an economist specializing in monetary and banking history, monetary theory and policy, and payments systems. Warren recently retired as Senior Research Officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, a position he held for almost 30 years. He also has taught at the University of Minnesota, the University of South Carolina, Duke University, Tulane University, and Virginia Tech.  He received his Ph.D. in economics from Carnegie Mellon University. He has published over fifty articles in academic journals, and is considered a subject matter expert in crypto-currency monetary policy.  Warren noted that "_Cryptocurrencies offer many new  options for the design and development of payments systems both now and in the future. I am excited to be a part of the development of SJCX and to help with the monetary policy and payments issues involved in making that currency successful. One can speculate and theorize about what those issues might be, but what is so exciting is that this is a chance for me to learn about and address those issues first hand._"

“_We’re extremely pleased to have Michael, Tyler and Warren join our team as we launch operations this month. Storj was built specifically for software developers and we are excited to allow them to start seeing the benefits of a distributed, end-to-end encrypted object storage network: higher security, better performance at half the cost of the big guys,_” said CEO Shawn Wilkinson.

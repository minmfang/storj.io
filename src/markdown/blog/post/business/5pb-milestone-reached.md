Today we are happy to announce that we have reached a major milestone for Storj! We now have over 5 PB (5,000 TB) of data stored on our network and that number is climbing fast towards 6PB! We want to thank all our uploaders and stress-testers who have helped us achieve this milestone.  We have shown that in addition to being the largest [decentralized storage cloud](http://littleskunk.myqnapcloud.com/StorjMap.html) in the world, Storj can also scale to accommodate demand.  

The map below illustrates the current distribution of Storj farmer nodes around the world:

Our team of engineers are hard at work to enable the network to scale a hundred-fold within the next year. The graph below illustrates how the total storage space occupied on the network has increased this year alone.

The same exponential growth is also true for our community of farmer nodes, which is approaching the 50,000 mark.

We again want to thank all our community members for their continued support. We couldn’t do it without you! To learn more about Storj, get interactive help and stay up to date with releases and events please join our [Community Chat](https://community.storj.io)!

In our town hall earlier this week, our team shared updates on our Open Source Partner Program; farmer payouts; marketing and branding; and our engineering progress on the new V3 network. We also shared a demo of the V3 private alpha, including its  4K video streaming capability! 

The town hall meeting included about 15 minutes of presentations, a 6-minute demo, and 20 minutes of live questions and answers. If you missed it on Zoom, you can watch the YouTube replay below. Closed captioning is available.

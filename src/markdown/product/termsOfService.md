</p>
<p>You and Company agree as follows:</p>

<p><b>1. Storj Labs Terms of Use</b></p>

<p>These Storage Terms incorporate by reference and supplement the <a target="_blank" href="/terms-of-use/" class="link">Storj Labs Terms of Use</a>.
The Storj Labs Terms of Use govern all access to and use of the Services, including the Storage Services. You agree to be bound by and comply with the Storj Labs
Terms of Use in connection with your access and use of the Services (including the Storage Services). The Storj Labs Terms of Use and these Storage Terms are

<p><b>2. Overview of Storage Platform</b></p>

<p>The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“<b>Storage Materials</b>”) via a distributed network of third-party devices
(“<b>Storage Nodes</b>”) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that independently
operate open-source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials
locally on your device and then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage
Nodes are not operated or maintained by Company, and Company has no responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes.
The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing
you to configure the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform,
including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations.
</p>

<p><b>3. Account</b></p>

<p>In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“<b>Account</b>”). In connection with your creation of any Account,
you will (i) provide accurate, current and complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary,
(iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage Services that you use for third-party services,
(iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized
activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that if you lose your private keys,
you may not be able to recover any Storage Materials.
</p>

<p><b>4. Payment</b></p>

<p>(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services ("<b>Fees</b>"). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes,
unless stated otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance of any increase to the Fees.
</p>
<p>(b)<b></b>Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us.
You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and authorize us to charge all Fees to that method.
If your payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended automatically.

store your Storage Materials.
</p>
<p>(c) Except as prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if you do not pay Fees on time. The late charge will be the lesser of 1.5 % of the unpaid amount each month or
the maximum rate permitted by law. You are responsible for all costs we incur to collect any past due amounts, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs.
We may suspend your access to the Storage Services immediately without notice if you fail to pay Fees on time.
</p>

<p>(a) You grant Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sublicensable right to reproduce, modify, distribute, and
export any Storage Materials solely as necessary to comply with your instructions to store such Storage Materials via the Storage Platform. This gives us the rights we
need to store and retrieve your Storage Materials as you direct us to.
</p>
<p>(b) Storage Materials are stored based on a storage contract with storage nodes for a period of 90 days. If Storage Materials must be stored longer than 90 days,
then the Storage Materials must be re-uploaded to renew the storage contract. If a storage contract is not renewed prior to the 90-day contract expiration,
the associated Storage Materials will be removed from the network and will be unavailable for download.<b> </b></p>
<p>(c) Company will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted.
You are solely responsible for backing up any Storage Materials.</p>
<p>(d) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials via the Storage Platform, and for
maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice,
to remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement
(including the <a href="/terms-of-use/">Storj Labs Terms of Use</a> relating to User Content).</p>
<p>(e) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services is in compliance with all applicable laws.
We make no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data.
You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the processing of
Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security protections,

    as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.</p>

via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform, and your Storage Materials may not be recoverable. If we terminate or suspend
your access to the Storage Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide
you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage Services.

At our quarterly town hall that was held this week, the Storj team shared details about our progress building the new V3 network, timelines around upcoming releases, and specifics about our token governance and policies. We also had some great questions from developers in the community during the nearly-hour-long Q&A at the end of the presentation. 

If you missed the town hall presentation, you can watch the YouTube replay below. Closed captioning is available.

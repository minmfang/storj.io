This week, we held our quarterly community town hall meeting where we shared the latest updates from the Storj Labs team. During this quarterâ€™s event, we announced the Vanguard release for our new V3 network! We also shared other updates from the Storj Labs team including details around our new Tardigrade network and website; a look back at our Explorer release, which welcomed the first storage node operators to the network; our quarterly Token Flows and Balances report; a greeting from our new board member, Katherine Johnson; and of course, our live Q&A. We had a record number of attendees this time around, and the most questions that have ever been submitted.

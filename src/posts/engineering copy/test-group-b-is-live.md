**Dear Storj supporters,**  
  
We are thrilled to announce the start of Test Group B, we have met our first milestone of 100 GB in less than a day, and the second one (100 TB) in less than a week. During our preliminary test we [rewarded participants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZYzMrW0i4qtonDIjk3pfwkKv6rHCOuUc7rUurIRPqU/edit#gid=0) with over 45,000 SJCX. At the time of writing the network is already over 500 TB. A big thank you goes to our community for the help provided so far.

We are ready for Test Group B. We will give users a few hours before we take a snapshot and distribute 100,000 SJCX in rewards for the second milestone. Any SJCX address can participate for testing purposes, but to receive a reward holding a 10,000 SJCX balance is required.

If you havenâ€™t already joined Test Group B, you can find a step-by-step guide to our client software [here](http://driveshare.org/dataserv.html). If you already installed the software in the previous email, an upgrade is mandatory to receive a reward. Non-crowdsale participants will have to contribute to the rewards pool at a later date (we would rather move forward on testing and do that later).

We are happy to have you with us and look forward to reaching the 1PB milestone with your help.

Have a great day,  
**The Storj Team**

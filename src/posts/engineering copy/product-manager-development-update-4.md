Since our last development update, a lot has happened here at Storj Labs. Two of our leaders, Ben Golub and Shawn Wilkinson, will be giving a keynote at [The Linux Foundation’s Open Source Summit in Vancouver on August 29th-31st](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/). We have been spending a lot of time getting ready for some major announcements that we will be making at the event so stay tuned for that news! Aside from that, we have made a lot of great progress on V3. Check out our latest accomplishments below.

Recent development accomplishments:

* We are now able to upload and download data on the V3 network!
* We made it possible to run an entire V3 network locally with just a few simple commands. This will be great for anyone who wants to contribute to the project or test the network locally.
* We finished creating the stat database, which keeps track of simple node metrics, like audit success ratios, latency, amount of data stored, etc. This data will be an integral part of our reputation system in the future.
* We updated the GitHub readme for the V3 repo.
* We increased the test coverage and uncovered some bugs, which we fixed.

In our next update, we plan to share updates on:

* Bug fixes and overall improvements in V3.
* Preparations for Open Source Summit and the announcements we will be making.
* Adding furnishing to support ‘buckets’ in V3. This will let you organize and store your data in different buckets as you please.
* Adding the finishing touches to our bandwidth accounting protocol, which is being used to keep track of how much bandwidth farmers have used.

**Dear Storj Supporters,**  
  
As we progress with Test Group B as well as development of our software we need our community testers to keep up to date with dataserv-client releases. The [latest release is v2.1.3](http://storj.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=edba9fc4ce8b9095a31859cba&id=5c58cf1640&e=813daa4cbf) and it is a **MANDATORY UPDATE** for every participant. At present most of our testers have already upgraded prior to this email. If you already upgraded you will simply have to restart (no rebuilding required) and point it to the URL in the guide. **If you do not upgrade, your client will stop working in 24-48 hours.** 

  
If you havenâ€™t already joined Test Group B, you can find a step-by-step guide to our client software [here](http://storj.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=edba9fc4ce8b9095a31859cba&id=246399258e&e=813daa4cbf). If you have installed the software previously, an upgrade is mandatory to receive a reward in upcoming snapshots.  
  
We have released updated Storj Crowdsale Terms with an Addendum to reflect Storj Labs taking over the funds from Storj. It can be found [here](http://storj.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=edba9fc4ce8b9095a31859cba&id=9fe5df16af&e=813daa4cbf).  
  
We are happy to have you with us and look forward to reach the 1PB milestone with your help.  

Have a great day,  
**The Storj Team**

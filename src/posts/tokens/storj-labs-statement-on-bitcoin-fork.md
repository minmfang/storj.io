We are actively monitoring the possible Bitcoin fork or coin split and anticipating any downstream effects to the Storj ecosystem should it occur. Some of the potential outcomes will cause the application that converts SJCX into STORJ to temporarily go offline. This is expected and should not be a cause for alarm. In the event it is necessary, Storj Labs will announce ahead of time its plan to take the [converter application](https://converter.storj.io/) down.  

<!--more-->

We understand that many of our users are still in the process of converting their Bitcoin based SJCX Counterparty token to the Ethereum based STORJ ERC20 token. As such, any major changes to the Bitcoin protocol will inevitably affect users with any remaining unconverted SJCX.

Please note that if you have already converted your SJCX to STORJ, this issue does not affect you. If you haven't, then we urge you to do so as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays should the [converter application](https://converter.storj.io/) be offline for an extended time period. Also, it may become difficult for our users to make payments for storage in Bitcoin, though our other payment options won't be affected. Please be especially alert to these measures potentially being implemented starting on or after July 31st, 2017.

You can monitor the current status of the converter app, billing and the other services Storj offers at [https://status.storj.io](https://status.storj.io) and follow [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/storjproject) for the latest updates from Storj Labs. Feel free to contact us by email at [hello@storj.io](mailto:hello@storj.io) if you have any further questions or concerns.

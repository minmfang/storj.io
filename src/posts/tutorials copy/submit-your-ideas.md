Dear Supporters,  
  
The Storj team is pleased with the progress of our ongoing Test Group C and the rhythm at which we release new software updates for Storj’s range of applications. We are also overwhelmed with the response and support received by the community and developers who have already started testing our platforms as well as building apps for it.  
  
We are also intrigued by the amount of ideas that our supporters and community at large come up and present us with. There are already a number of ideas we are taking in consideration and we want to make sure you, our supporters, are also on the same wavelength when it comes to deciding which one/s to implement and move forward. At Storj we have always adopted a very simple mechanism when it comes to agreeing on new projects, changes to the platform as well as suggestions: let our supporters and community be part of the process!

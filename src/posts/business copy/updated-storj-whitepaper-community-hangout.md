Dear Storj supporters,  
  
It’s been almost two years since the release of the first version of the Storj whitepaper, and the start of Storj. When it was released, Storj was only a theory, but now it’s a vibrant and robust network with over 1,500 TB of data stored and 8,500 TB of capacity and growing. The V2 whitepaper updates what worked, what didn't work, and what will be built in the future.

The time has come to put all of our technical knowhow into context and are very excited to announce the release of a revised Storj whitepaper on the morning of December 15th. This is exactly two years after the release of the first Storj whitepaper. We will also follow with a community hangout.

**Storj Community Hangout**  
December is also the time of the year when we reflect on our achievements and set the pace for the year to come. We will be hosting a Community Hangout to discuss recent developments, as well as keeping an eye on our near future plans and beyond.

Storj Labs is happy to invite everyone in the community to participate in a world-wide accessible town hall meeting. At the town hall, attendees will hear from Storj team leaders about our product roadmap, recent accomplishments, internal staffing, community growth, and our 2018 high-level goals. We will share a presentation followed by a 20 minute session at the end to answer community questions, which can be submitted via email and chat during the town hall. The town hall meeting will be recorded and be made available for those who cannot attend.

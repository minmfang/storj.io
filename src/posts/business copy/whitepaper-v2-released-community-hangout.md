Dear Storj supporters,

You have heard about it a few days ago and finally here it is ... we are thrilled to announce the release of the new Storj Whitepaper v2.  
  
<!--more-->

  
It has taken over two years of hard work, tons of community feedback, and many new team members to where we are today. The v2 whitepaper updates what worked, what didn't work, and what will be built in the future.

**Community Hangout**  
As usual around this time of the year, and specially for this occasion, we have arranged a Community Hangout which is going live in a few hours, at 4PM EST.

Today, the Storj Labs team is excited to announce we have launched a waitlist for farmers who would like early access to the next version of the Storj network. Community members who would like to join the waitlist can [visit the Storj Labs website to reserve their slot](storj.io/sign-up-farmer) as one of the first people to share their hard drive on the V3 network. [We previously opened](https://storj.io/sign-up) a V3 waitlist for developers, companies and other people who would like to store data on the new network. **This waitlist is for farmers who would like to share their excess hard drive capacity with the network in exchange for STORJ tokens.  
**

At the launch of the alpha and beta of the new network, we will be limiting both farmer and renter access to ensure we can maintain a healthy balance of both supply and demand. This will improve stability and testing, while also limiting any impact to reliability, performance or file durability as we fine-tune the platform for production launch.

Farmers who join the waitlist will be given early access to set up a storage node on the network.

**The Latest on Network V3**

Our team has made significant progress building V3 of the Storj network. Just this week, [our engineering team released an update](https://storj.io/blog/2018/07/prod.-mgr-development-update-2/) that highlights the latest development milestones. We also [recently released a V3 overview video](https://storj.io/blog/2018/06/a-look-at-storj-labs-decentralized-cloud-storage-architecture-with-jt-olio/) with Storj Labs Director of Engineering JT Olio, where he explains how the new network will overcome many of the limitations weâ€™ve uncovered in the current system to improve reliability and scalability, while also achieving AWS S3 compatibility.

Our next quarterly town hall is just around the corner. Everyone in our community is welcome to join the meeting, which we will live stream and make accessible worldwide.

In this meeting, hear from Ben Golub, our executive chairman and interim CEO, Shawn Wilkinson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, and JT Olio, director of engineering. Topics include an update on Storj, product development news, progress toward releasing the updated V3 network architecture, and farmer payouts. Presentations will last about 20 minutes, and there will be lots of room for Q&A. Please send questions you’d like us to address to [townhall@storj.io](townhall@storj.io).

This is your chance to give us feedback and discuss topics related to Storj and our community. We’ll record the town hall meeting.

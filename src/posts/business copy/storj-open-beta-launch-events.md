Dear Storj supporters, we have some great news to share with you!

1. Decentralized & Encrypted

The Storj team will be at [Decentralized & Encrypted](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/berlin-june-1st-the-mission-to-upgrade-the-internet-an-open-conversation-with-edward-snowden-d288fb2c1ec6), a BlueYard event held in Berlin on June 1st. Billed as “the mission to upgrade the internet & an open conversation with Edward Snowden,” BlueYard Capital will host representatives from the media, the EFF, and many notable projects in the blockchain space. CEO Shawn Wilkinson will be presenting our decentralized vision for object storage. All talks and panels will be video recorded and published online.

2. Berlin Open Beta Launch Party

While we’re in Berlin, we’d like to invite you to the [Storj Launch Party](https://storj.splashthat.com/) on June 2nd, at 6PM. We’re going to demo the open beta of the Storj network and our decentralized object storage service. We are excited to celebrate this release in Berlin, home of the largest Storj community in Europe and some of our most talented contributing developers. Inspired by the entrepreneurial energy and the incredible pace of innovation in the German capital, we are fired up to celebrate our open beta there! We look forward to hearing feedback on how we can best serve developers in Europe, and worldwide. If you are going to be in Berlin, come and join us for food and fun! Make sure to RSVP!

3. Global Open Beta Launch Party

We know that not everyone can be in Berlin with us, so we’ll also host a [Google Hangout](https://storjhangout.splashthat.com/) the next day, June 3rd. We’ll be picking up questions live from the #chat channel on Slack. If you haven’t joined yet do so at [http://slack.storj.io](https://community.storj.io/). This is your chance to see what we have been working on, and talk directly with the founders.

Have a great day!

The Storj Team

We’re excited to announce that Storj is officially out of beta! Our platform has been completely free of charge as we stabilized our technology and optimized performance. To start, every registered user can use up 25 GB storage and 25 GB bandwidth (every month!) free for 12 months.

**What happens when I go over the limit?**
  
If you go over the free allowance and you have payment information on file, you will only be billed for your usage above the free allowance. Currently, that’s 25 GB storage and 25GB bandwidth every month. If you do not have payment information on file, you may be rate limited until you submit your payment information.

**How much does it cost?**  
Storage is $0.015 per GB per month, and bandwidth is $0.05 per GB. This is about half the cost of competing services, and a large percentage goes directly into the pockets of our farmers.

**Can I keep using Storj for free?**  
Great question! We just launched our referral program, so you can invite your friends to Storj and get an additional 50GB of storage and 50GB of bandwidth once they join and spend $10. There’s no limit, so invite away! Log in and head to the [referrals page](https://app.storj.io/#/dashboard/referrals).

**Can I pay in BTC or SJCX?**  
Currently, we don’t have automatic billing options for using cryptocurrencies, but we plan on adding them in the near future. In the meantime, we will manually accept BTC and SJCX payments for large users. Please contact [sales@storj.io](mailto:sales@storj.io) for more information.

Thanks as always for your continued support, and for making the open source and distributed web possible!
